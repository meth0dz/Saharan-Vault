----- Sahara -----

- Compile Sahara as a kernel module.
- Getting a potential address for the sys_call_table can be done using the
	get_addr program.  It's source can be compiled with a standard
	gcc call.
- Using Sahara
	Insert the module using the following command.
	insmod ./sahara.ko [sct_addr=0xYYYYYYYY]
	You can now check to see if it found and replaced sys_call_table by 
		reading /var/log/everything.log.
	You can then remove Sahara using the next command.
	rmmod sahara.ko
- Keep in mind that I do now guarentee the successful use of Sahara and that I am not
	responsible for any damage that comes to your system as a result of Sahara.
	It is a kernel module so it is very possible that any bug will bring your
	system to it's knees.  Also, depending on how your kernel was built, it may
	be impossible for you to force remove modules from your kernel.
